# By default CAF installs itself into /usr/lib, but some distros may use
# directories like /usr/lib64 or even /usr/lib32, the right location is
# expected to be held by "_libdir" macro. Unfortunately, there is no way
# for file directive to specify another target directory name, so we have
# to move library files into appropriate directory manually right after
# installation complete. Note that we run unit tests after that as we really
# do not want to ship broken package. 
# Also note that we completely clean up old buildroot before installing, in
# order not to accidentaly pack old files left since previous build.
